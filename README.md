# Project Overview 
In this project I was acting as a senior data analyst at the company Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. I was given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study, as well as a top-level summary of the study results. 

## Analysis of Findings 
•	From the data provided, you can draw the conclusion that Capomulin is performing better than the other treatments listed. I was able to see the following:
•	Capomulin and Ramicane had similar results with average tumor volume, before and after treatment. They both had the lowest average tumor volume vs. the rest of the treatments and they both had the highest number of observed mouse timepoints.
•	You can see sepcifically for Capomulin, there is a correlation with mouse weight. Higher weight had, on average, a higher tumor volume.
•	Placebo had a lower average of tumor volume vs. Naftisol and Ketapril, who had the largest, and all with similar number of observed mouse timepoints.
•	No correlation was identified with the gender of the mouse, with male sitting at 51% and female at 49%.
•	If more visualations were conducted, there may be some potential to identify some correlations between age and weight of the mouse and the rest of the treatments performance.

### Instructions for Final Work
My final Jupyter notebook can be found in the Pymaceuticals folder, "pymaceuticals_notebook.ipynb".
My analysis is written in the final workbook listed above. 

I worked with colleague, Victoria Scott, on the first part of the code (before Summary Statistics) so you may see some similarity in the script there. 
I used the Xpert AI Assistant to revise and assist with the rest of my script.

Thank you!
