Hello, 

My final Jupyter notebook can be found in the Pymaceuticals folder, "pymaceuticals_notebook.ipynb".

My analysis is written in the final workbook listed above. 

I worked with colleague, Victoria Scott, on the first part of the code (before Summary Statistics) so you may see some similarity in the script there. 
I used the Xpert AI Assistant to revise and assist with the rest of my script.

Thank you!
